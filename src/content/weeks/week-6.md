title: "Data & Mapping Data"
description: "What is data? How can we setup a structure in code to visualize our data?"
longDescription: |

  This week we are exploring the concept of data and how we can effectively map and visualize it using code. 
  <br/><br/>
  We will learn how to structure data, use loops and objects to manage it, and employ mapping techniques to translate data values into visual elements. This will be the foundation for our upcoming project on data sculpture.

## Assignment

<br/><br/>
This week, you will research data and look for a dataset that resonates with you. It could be related to your interests, a social issue, or something you find intriguing. Once you have your dataset, you can try creating a visualization using p5.js.
<br/><br/>

- What structure does the data have? How can you map it to visual elements like position, size, color, or shape?
- Use loops and object structures to efficiently handle and visualize the data.
- Can `map` help you translate data values into visual properties?
  <br/>
  This is the beginning of our project 2: data sculpture. We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks.
