title: "Critical Data Viz"
description: "We will talk step by step on strategies to visualize data and our responsibilities when working with data."
longDescription: |

  This week we are continuing our exploration of data visualization by discussing various strategies to effectively visualize data. We will also touch upon the ethical responsibilities that come with working with data.

## Quick Recap

- We can use `loadJSON()` to fetch data from external sources like APIs or Google Sheets.
- `for` loops and arrays to efficiently handle and visualize data.
- Use `map()` to translate data values (input) into visual properties (output).
- Use `array.map(item => item.property)` to find specific properties of each item in the array, such as min and max values.
- Use `array.push()` to dynamically add new objects to an array.
- Use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as `class` and `constructor` to create reusable code structures.

This week, you will continue working on your data sculpture project. Think about how your data can be turned into both a digital and physical object. Consider using Object-Oriented Programming to structure your code and make it more modular.
<br/><br/>

- What kind of physical form will best represent your data? How can you use materials and techniques to bring your data sculpture to life?
- What is your data about? How did you clean, filter, or otherwise edit your dataset? How did each step affect the patterns or narratives that emerge?
- How can they translate into an object using attributes like color, size, shape, position, scale, material?
- What’s your way of conceptualizing the system? If using this method of inputs and output. What are the inputs and outputs of your system?
- What are things you are including on your legends? How are you designing your legends? Other than printing as a separate paper?

  This is the continuing process of our [project 2: data sculpture](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material).
