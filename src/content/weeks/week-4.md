description: "How can we use loops and custom functions to create more efficient and flexible code?"
longDescription: |
  This week, we are learning how loops and custom functions can make our code more efficient and flexible. Loops allow us to repeat code blocks, while custom functions let us encapsulate reusable code. Together, they help us create intricate and expressive designs with less effort.

## Assignment

**Due:** Sep 23, 2025
<br/><br/>
<a class="btn-primary" href="https://forms.gle/Fev6UZQf8z8rzyUg9">Submit Assignment</a>
<br/><br/>
For the assignment, focus on polishing and refining your Flexible Manifesto in p5.js. Make sure your system runs smoothly, generates variation effectively, and produces visually compelling results.

- Use `for loops` and `custom functions` to clean up repetitive code and make your system more efficient.
- Ensure your system can produce **at least** five distinct physical artifacts, each with different dimensions. They do not have to all be prints...explore other fabrication methods if you will (sticker, laser cut, embroidery, etc). Make sure you BRING the artifacts to class next week
- Use p5.js as your main tool for designing, and export your design from it as SVG or JPEG/PNG to adjust in other software if needed.
- Prepare to present your artifacts alongside your p5.js sketch, showing both the system and its outputs.
- Print out a small "label" explaining your design system and the variations it can produce. Include your name and the title of your piece. We will have an open studio next week.
