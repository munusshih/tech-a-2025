title: "Object Oriented"
description: "We will talk about how to use API to fetch data and how to construct objects for better code organization."
longDescription: |

  We are continuing our exploration of data by diving deeper into APIs and how to fetch data from external sources. Additionally, we will introduce the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help organize our code better and make it more modular.

  Object-Oriented Programming allows us to create objects that encapsulate data and behavior, making our code more reusable and easier to manage. We will discuss how this paradigm can be applied in our data sculpture projects.

## Using Opensheets as API

- [OpenSheets Documentation](https://opensheet.elk.sh/)
- [How to Get a Google Sheet as JSON](https://ben.page/google-sheets-json)
  <br/><br/>
  You can use OpenSheets to fetch data from Google Sheets as JSON. This is particularly useful for projects where you want to update data dynamically without changing the code.
  <br/><br/>
  Simply use the code `https://opensheet.elk.sh/SHEET_ID/SHEET_NAME` to fetch the data.

This week, you will continue working on your data sculpture project. Think about how your data can be turned into both a digital and physical object. Consider using Object-Oriented Programming to structure your code and make it more modular.
<br/><br/>

- What kind of physical form will best represent your data? How can you use materials and techniques to bring your data sculpture to life?
- What is your data about? What are some interesting insights?
- How can they translate into an object using attributes like color, size, shape, position, scale, material?
- How can you create enough variation in your design while using rules to maintain consistency?
- How does randomness contribute to your design, and where might it cause unexpected results?
  <br/><br/><br/>
  This is the continuing process of our [project 2: data sculpture](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material).

## Readings

I found [this interesting article](https://www.instructables.com/Data-Crystals-3D-Data-Visualizations-from-Open-Dat/) that construct these crystal-like data sculptures from open data.
