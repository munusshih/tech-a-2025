title: "Data Sculpture"
description: "We will talk about how to use API to fetch data and how to create tangible data sculptures."
longDescription: |

  This week we are diving deeper into data by exploring APIs and how to fetch data from external sources. We will also discuss the concept of data sculpture, where we translate data into physical forms.

This week, you will continue working on your data sculpture project. Focus on refining your visualization and consider how you can translate it into a physical form. Think about materials, scale, and how the data can be represented tangibly.
<br/><br/>

- What kind of physical form will best represent your data? How can you use materials and techniques to bring your data sculpture to life?
- What are some insights or stories that your data sculpture conveys? How does the physical form enhance the understanding of the data?
- Utilize the techniques we discussed in class, such as fetching data from APIs, handling missing data, finding min and max values or export as STL to map your data effectively.
  <br/><br/><br/>
  This is the continuing process of our [project 2: data sculpture](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material). We will continue to refine and develop this project over the next few weeks. The full description is [here](https://tech-a.designfuture.space/#module-2:-data-as-material).
