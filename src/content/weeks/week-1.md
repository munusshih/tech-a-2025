  <br/><br/>
  Choose a short piece of text in your preferred language. It can be a poem, a quote, an excerpt from your diary, or any other form of writing. The text should be personal, poetic, or culturally meaningful to you, serving as a manifesto or statement that reflects your values and beliefs.
  <br/><br/>
  Collect visual and material inspirations (typography, print experiments, manifestos), and try to recreate them in [**p5.js Editor**](https://editor.p5js.org/)! When in doubt, look them up in the [**p5 reference**](https://beta.p5js.org/reference/) or ask for help in [**google chat**](https://chat.google.com/room/AAQATTfE9mA?cls=7).
  <br/><br/>
  Document what's working and what's not working and submit these findings along with the assignment.

## Workshop 1

- Laser Cutting (by Matt Martin & Moein Shashaei)

## Readings

This is not a must, but a beautiful writing from Andrew Blauvelt traces graphic design's transformation through three key phases: the pre-digital craft era, the digital disruption of the 1980s-90s, and the current "postproduction" era.

  If wanna read about how Processing and p5.js was developed, this is another interesting read from AIGA:
