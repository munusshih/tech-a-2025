You'll have to but the bottom shape first with the fill or stroke, then the top shape with their designated fill or stroke.  This helped when I was doing repeated shapes. ",

I realized that the sequence of code execution is a critical aspect of programming, and it’s something I need to spend more time practicing. I also discovered that some functions are restricted to either 2D or 3D contexts, and I hope to explore ways to integrate them so they can work together more effectively.",

    "response": "I always found coding a little scary, but now that I’ve started, I’m actually loving it and can’t wait to try more and learn more. One of the first things I understood is how functions work. For example, the setup() function runs once at the very beginning  it’s where we set up the canvas, styles, and any initial values. After that, the draw() function keeps running in a loop, unless we stop it using noLoop().\nI’m also learning new functions step by step and experimenting with them, which has been really exciting. One thing I struggled with was uploading an image. I realized that it needs to be placed in the “assets” folder, but for some reason, I couldn’t get it to work. That’s something I still want to figure out.\nAnother question I had while exploring loops and patterns was about saving images. If I want to save a specific frame (and not every single one in the loop), I learned that I can use functions like saveCanvas() or saveFrames(), but apply them conditionally,  for example, only when a certain frame number is reached.",
