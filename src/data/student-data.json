Without the noise of words, in nature there is no need for much speech, and we can feel each other’s existence, as well as the beauty of blending with nature.\nFor me, I especially enjoy being alone in quiet places surrounded by plants.

    "projectDescription": "Cosmic Trust is about believing in the universe..not in a blind, passive way, but as an active, guiding energy that intersects with our efforts. I began my journey as a strict atheist, rooted entirely in science and logic. I still deeply respect science, yet over time, a part of me has shifted toward the spiritual. I’ve realized there exists a subtle energy in the universe, a force that shapes and influences life in ways we may not fully understand. It’s not about expecting miracles without effort; manifestation works, but only when paired with consistent action and intention. Challenges don’t disappear, they are the universe’s way of shaping us, building resilience, and nudging us toward our goals.\nThe universe is both beautiful and powerful. Celestial events, like eclipses, illustrate this dynamic energy. The patterns these movements form in the sky are symbolic of life itself: moments of darkness give way to light, and temporary interruptions can lead to new perspectives. Observing these patterns reminds us that life is a rhythm of challenges and revelations, and the unseen forces guiding us are as natural and inevitable as the movement of the planets.\nIn Cosmic Trust, these celestial patterns are translated into visual forms. The orbit of the moon around the sun, the shadows of eclipses, and the subtle waves of energy patterns all symbolize the universe’s influence on our personal journey. The shapes, rotations, and flows in my project are minimalistic but intentional, representing the invisible energy at work in our lives. They serve as a reminder that even small actions, when aligned with intention and trust, contribute to larger outcomes.\nThis project is an exploration of the harmony between action and faith, reason and wonder. By observing cosmic patterns, we recognize that life is interconnected, and growth often comes from surrendering to forces greater than ourselves while still working toward our goals. The visual patterns (ellipses, orbits, and rotations) reflect not only the science of celestial mechanics but also the spiritual idea that energy flows through all things, guiding, shaping, and supporting our journey.\nThe Cosmic Trust project, implemented through p5.js, visualizes this philosophy. Using code, I simulate celestial patterns and movements, such as eclipses, orbital rotations, and abstract energy flows. Users can interact with these elements, witnessing how forces intersect, influence, and create outcomes. The result is a meditative, immersive experience that encourages reflection on one’s personal journey, resilience, and the unseen energies at play.",

One of the first things I understood is how functions work. For example, the setup() function runs once at the very beginning  it’s where we set up the canvas, styles, and any initial values. After that, the draw() function keeps running in a loop, unless we stop it using noLoop().\nI’m also learning new functions step by step and experimenting with them, which has been really exciting. One thing I struggled with was uploading an image. I realized that it needs to be placed in the “assets” folder, but for some reason, I couldn’t get it to work. That’s something I still want to figure out.\nAnother question I had while exploring loops and patterns was about saving images. If I want to save a specific frame (and not every single one in the loop), I learned that I can use functions like saveCanvas() or saveFrames(), but apply them conditionally,  for example, only when a certain frame number is reached.",

    "projectDescription": "This project inspired by Chinese history,Farewell My Concubine (1993),  is a tragic gay love drama set amid war, political upheaval, and the shifting tides of 20th-century Beijing. The story of Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou blends opera, love, betrayal, and survival.\nThe phrase “人，得自個兒，成全自個兒” (“One can only rely on oneself to be complete”) is deeply relevant. Dieyi devotes his life to Xiaolou, but in the end, he cannot depend on love, loyalty, or society for fulfillment. The tragedy shows that only by facing oneself—identity, pain, and truth—can one find dignity, even in despair.",

    "projectDescription": "Continuing on with my quote of passion fuels purpose. I kept sort of the same layout when adding the GUI and variables. It is not completely the same but it's okay because it would've changed with the moving variables. First when I was working on this project I changed the shape of the circle to a square. And then I restricted the square to go to top left to bottom right. Having a fixed points. I did the same thing with another smaller square. Each of the squares you can change the size and the color. One last thing that I added was a constraint. There is a circle 'constraint' in the bigger square. Even when the square is the smallest it can be. Leading me to my randomization idea. In the constraint, the circle, every time the code is run/ restarted the size will be randomized 5-10. I wanted it to run once so I out in within set up instead of draw which loops. ",

In the past, I focused on expressing text by breaking it down into points, but this time I explored the same sentence through the medium of lines in an entirely new way. Unlike points, which convey a concentrated and fixed impression, lines stretch fluidly, creating a sense of flow and rhythm. Through this, I sought to explore the possibility that the same message can deliver a completely different visual experience. By placing no restrictions on color or thickness, I aimed to express the infinite potential for expansion and the creative possibilities inherent in the qualities of lines.",

In particular, adjusting randomness and noise was tricky, since even small changes in values could dramatically alter the overall impression, requiring extensive experimentation and trial and error.",

    "projectDescription": "The concept of manifestation has always fascinated me—the idea that our thoughts, intentions, and focus can influence reality. Manifestation is more than wishful thinking; it is a conscious process of directing energy toward specific outcomes, visualizing them clearly, and aligning one’s actions with those visions. This project is inspired by that principle, aiming to create a visual experience that embodies the power of intention and focus. The central phrase, “COSMIC TRUST,” represents faith in both the universe and oneself, serving as a reminder that alignment with one’s inner goals is a gradual but achievable process. The subsequent appearance of the words “THOUGHT” and the customizable text below encourages reflection, transforming the canvas into a space where abstract ideas such as belief, creativity, and visualization become tangible.\nMy vision for this project was to design an interactive, animated piece that combines digital media and engagement to encourage viewers to reflect on the power of their thoughts. I wanted the letters of “COSMIC TRUST” to start scattered across the canvas, symbolizing the chaos and randomness of unaligned thoughts, and gradually converge into a precise, harmonious formation to represent clarity and focus. The delayed emergence of the word “THOUGHT” mirrors the moment when a focused intention crystallizes into awareness, while the user-customizable text allows participants to insert their personal vision or mantra. This ensures that each interaction with the piece becomes unique and meaningful. The inclusion of a video background adds depth and movement, providing a cosmic and immersive atmosphere that resonates with the theme of trust and universal alignment.\nThe code structure was designed to bring this vision to life. Each letter is treated as an object with properties such as position, size, and target coordinates. Initially, the letters are randomly scattered, with varied sizes to convey disorder. The lerp() function is used to interpolate positions and sizes smoothly over time, creating an animation where letters gradually align into the intended formation. The progress variable controls this transition, while a timer ensures that the secondary text appears only after the main animation completes. By integrating a GUI powered by dat.GUI, I enabled real-time customization: users can adjust text color, reset the animation, control progress manually, input personalized text, and save the canvas as an image. This combination of animation and interactivity transforms the viewer from a passive observer into an active participant in the creation process.\nUltimately, this project serves as a visual metaphor for manifestation: scattered ideas and intentions, once focused and nurtured, align into coherent outcomes. The interplay of motion, interactivity, and cosmic visuals encourages viewers to pause, reflect, and connect with their inner thoughts. By translating abstract concepts like trust, intention, and personal vision into a digital, interactive experience, the project demonstrates the power of visualization while showcasing how coding and creative design can intersect to produce meaningful, immersive artwork.",

    "weeklyResponse": "Previously, I had questions about how to add an image to the canvas and was initially a bit confused. After learning how to include images, I thought, why not try a video? I explored how to integrate a video background and experimented with a small animation as well. This allowed me to work with variables, transitions, and timing, making the project more dynamic and interactive. I enjoyed experimenting with different effects and seeing how motion and visuals could enhance the concept I wanted to convey.\nDuring the process, I also explored using dat.GUI to create a user interface for controlling parameters like text color, progress, and custom text. While I learned how to manage normal text within the canvas boundaries, I realized I still have questions about ensuring that GUI-controlled text stays within the canvas limits, especially when breaking it into multiple lines or adjusting dynamically based on user input. This has motivated me to explore further techniques for responsive text placement and alignment.",

By adjusting the force based on the distance between the mouse and particles, nearby particles scatter strongly while distant ones return slowly to their original positions, creating a natural motion. If the interaction distance is too short, particles barely move, limiting visual dynamics; if too long, the entire system scatters excessively, creating a chaotic effect.

    "projectDescription": "For this project, I wanted to create a dynamic and visually engaging composition that incorporated several techniques and ideas I had learned in the last class. The main focus was on combining textures, shapes, typography, and interactivity to produce a piece that is both aesthetic and conceptually tied to my theme.The canvas starts with a gradient background that transitions from grey to black, giving a subtle depth and cosmic feel to the composition. Over this, I added a base circular shape, filled with a light grey color, which serves as an anchor for the other elements. On top of this, I applied a texture image using the dodge blend mode, which highlights the lighter parts of the image while maintaining the overall color harmony. This combination of gradient, base shape, and texture creates a layered effect that gives the canvas more visual interest and dimensionality.A key element in this work is the letters forming \"COSMIC TRUST,\" which I split and randomly positioned across the canvas with semi-transparent fills, allowing overlaps that create subtle interactions and a balanced chaos. One random letter receives a shear transformation each run, adding uniqueness and emphasizing cosmic randomness. I incorporated a dat.GUI interface to toggle between random and aligned letters and added buttons to save the canvas as PNG or SVG. This project let me combine gradients, textures, text manipulation, and vector graphics. Experimenting with shear and interactivity made the piece visually dynamic and conceptually aligned, reflecting what I’ve learned in class.\n",

Also, to enrich the background, two if-else conditions were used to control the random size of the borders and the floating of their positions, making the picture more dynamic.

    "projectDescription": "For this new version of my code, I made sure that the strokes of my shapes were only the bigger ones. So there are noStroke for the smaller shapes to make it look cleaner. Another thing I added was the color palette. For the color palette I wanted it to decrease when the canvas size got smaller. So I thought about to tie the color palette to the canvas size that is being randomized 5 ways. I'm not too sure if I did this right but I see the palette changing when I drag it on my gui.",
    "credit": "I used chatGPT to help me with my code. I had some trouble on doing the decreasing color palette. As well as if I wanted to manually modify my shapes to make it look cleaner. ",

    "weeklyResponse": "If I wanted to do randomization for my canvas size but only could pick out of five options, would the probability of the computer running it create more duplicates rather than new canvas sizes? I wanted to approach it this way because I want my color palette to decrease when my canvas gets smaller. & darker colors when it gets bigger.  ",
    "teacherFeedback": "You could certainly do `let canvasSizes = []`, and just have 5 options only, while keeping the conditionals for color palettes to still be more of a spectrum, like `background(width/100)` for example.",
